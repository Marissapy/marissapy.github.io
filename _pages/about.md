## Introduction

I am **Yan Pan (潘彦)**, an undergraduate student majoring in Clinical Medicine at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**. Since 2022, I have been involved in research at the university’s **Center for Aging Research** , where I combine experimental and computational methods to study the biology of aging.

I’m currently building this website! I will be applying for MS/PhD programs for Fall 2027. If you're interested in my work, feel free to contact me at yanpan@zohomail.com.

## Research Focus

My primary research interest lies in **aging medicine**, particularly in identifying compounds that influence healthspan and lifespan in model systems. I am interested in applying **computational biology** approaches to explore which natural or synthetic compounds may be beneficial or harmful to biological systems. While I have worked extensively with _Caenorhabditis elegans_, I view it as one of several useful model organisms—including cultured cells and other systems—for understanding the biological effects of candidate compounds. Beyond phenotypic screening, I am also interested in uncovering the underlying **molecular mechanisms** that mediate these effects.

## Skills

My research balances work in both the wet and dry lab:
- **Wet lab (50%)**: Includes culturing _C. elegans_ and mammalian cells, performing cellular and molecular biology experiments, and developing high-throughput pipelines for compound screening.
- **Dry lab (50%)**: Focuses on **machine learning modeling**, **multi-omics data analysis**, **molecular dynamics simulations**, and **virtual screening** of bioactive molecules.

## Broader Research Experience

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have conducted research internships at several prestigious institutions, including:
- **Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention**
- **Peking Union Medical College (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences)**
- **West China School of Medicine, Sichuan University**

These experiences allowed me to explore diverse topics, such as:

- **Large-scale virtual screening** of allosteric modulators targeting GPCRs
- **Environmental toxicology**
- **Computer vision applications** in biological image analysis

I value the integration of computational analysis and experimental validation in biological research. My long-term academic goal is to uncover the **fundamental mechanisms driving human aging** and to identify effective interventions for its delay. I believe that computational biology provides a powerful lens to guide experimental design and hypothesis generation, making it a cornerstone of my research methodology.

## Looking Ahead

I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities related to aging biology/cell biology/computational biology. I hope to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying aging and to the development of effective interventions that promote long-term health.
