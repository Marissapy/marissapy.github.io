## Introduction

I am **Yan Pan (潘彦)**, a researcher working at the intersection of **synthetic biology** and **toxicology**. My work focuses on developing safe and effective synthetic biology products through computational design and experimental validation.

I combine computational biology, machine learning, and experimental approaches to assess the safety and efficacy of synthetic biology applications, particularly in food ingredients and therapeutic compounds. Currently, I am involved in toxicity assessment testing for D-allulose, a food ingredient produced through synthetic biology cell factories, supported by the Beijing government for market approval.

If you're interested in my work, feel free to contact me at yanpan@zohomail.com.

## Research Focus

My research integrates **synthetic biology**, **computational toxicology**, and **safety assessment**:

- **Safety by Design**: Developing predictive frameworks to assess potential toxicity early in the synthetic biology product design phase
- **Toxicity Assessment**: Evaluating safety profiles of synthetic biology products, including food ingredients and bioactive compounds
- **Computational Modeling**: Using machine learning and molecular simulations to predict biological effects and guide experimental design

## Current Projects

I am currently participating in toxicity assessment testing for **D-allulose**, a food ingredient produced through synthetic biology cell factories. This project, supported by the Beijing government, aims to evaluate the safety profile of this synthetic biology-derived product for market approval.

## Skills

- **Synthetic Biology**: Cell factory design, metabolic engineering, protein engineering
- **Computational Toxicology**: Machine learning modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, virtual screening
- **Experimental Validation**: High-throughput screening, cellular and molecular biology assays, toxicity testing
