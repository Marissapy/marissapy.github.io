excerpt: 'The WormCNN project originated from challenges I encountered during C. elegans lifespan assays (2022–present). In practice, human observers can often visually distinguish worms that appear biologically older or younger than others. This led me to explore whether a computer vision model could be trained to replicate this capability—enabling earlier and more objective assessments of worm health status (e.g., premature aging or youthfulness). Since 2025, I have been continuing to develop and enhance WormCNN to expand its functionality and accuracy.'

The WormCNN project originated from challenges I encountered during _C. elegans_ lifespan assays (2022–present). In practice, human observers can often visually distinguish worms that appear biologically older or younger than others. This led me to explore whether a computer vision model could be trained to replicate this capability—enabling earlier and more objective assessments of worm health status (e.g., premature aging or youthfulness). Since 2025, I have been continuing to develop and enhance WormCNN to expand its functionality and accuracy.
