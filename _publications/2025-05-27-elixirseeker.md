collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/elixirseeker
excerpt: 'This project spanned from my first year (2022) to my third year (2025) of undergraduate study. I applied machine learning techniques to model anti-aging compound databases and conducted experimental validation using Caenorhabditis elegans. I am grateful for the guidance of Professor Hao Li (also affiliated with UCSF) and Professor Bo Xian at the Center for Aging Research.'
