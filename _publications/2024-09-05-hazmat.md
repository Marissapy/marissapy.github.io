title: "Optimization of polyethylene terephthalate biodegradation using a self-assembled multi-enzyme cascade strategy"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/PETase
excerpt: 'This is my first academic publication. After participating in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition 2023, I had the privilege of joining a protein engineering laboratory, where I became involved in the rational design of PETase under the guidance of Professor Juan Feng and Professor Lixia Tang. I developed a high-throughput pipeline for virtual mutagenesis and molecular docking, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, which effectively enhanced the enzymatic activity of PETase. I must say, I’ve also developed a strong passion for synthetic biology.'
