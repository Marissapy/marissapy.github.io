title: "The joint toxicity effect of glyphosate and cadmium in a concentration-dependent manner on nematode Caenorhabditis elegans"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/GPS
excerpt: 'This was my first experience working on an RNA-seq analysis project. In this study, I was responsible for all bioinformatics analyses, working in collaboration with Zhihang Huang, who conducted the wet-lab experiments. We were fortunate to identify a novel Cd²⁺-responsive gene using the GENIE3 algorithm based on random forest. Additionally, we applied computer vision techniques to preliminarily assess the activity states of C. elegans under different conditions. This publication also marks the first paper from our C. elegans lab at the Center for Aging Research.'

This was my first experience working on an RNA-seq analysis project. In this study, I was responsible for all bioinformatics analyses, working in collaboration with Zhihang Huang, who conducted the wet-lab experiments. We were fortunate to identify a novel Cd²⁺-responsive gene using the GENIE3 algorithm based on random forest. Additionally, we applied computer vision techniques to preliminarily assess the activity states of _C. elegans_ under different conditions. This publication also marks the first paper from our _C. elegans_ lab at the Center for Aging Research.
