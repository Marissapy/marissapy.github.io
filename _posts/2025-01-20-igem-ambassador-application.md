## 1. What are the main barriers for people in your region to engage with the iGEM Community and the topic of synthetic biology?

I come from the southwest region of China, which accounts for nearly one-fourth of the country's land area. However, only a few top-tier universities in this region have the chance to engage in the iGEM competition or build active synthetic biology teams.

One major barrier is the language and information gap. Most iGEM resources, technical documentation, and community discussions are in English. For students in western China, especially those from resource-limited universities, this becomes a significant obstacle to understanding and participating in global scientific communication.

Another challenge lies in the unequal distribution of educational and research resources. Compared with eastern China, universities in the southwest often lack advanced lab facilities, specialized mentors, and structured courses in synthetic biology. Students rarely have opportunities to explore the field or receive interdisciplinary training that integrates biology, engineering, and design.

As a result, while enthusiasm for innovation is growing, many potential contributors are still excluded from the iGEM community due to these structural limitations.

## 2. What would you like to change or improve in your regional iGEM Community?

In recent years, the "Southwest iGEM Alliance" has made great progress in connecting regional teams. Building upon that foundation, I would like to use digital technology to break geographical and resource barriers.

I envision creating a digital infrastructure that redefines the geographic boundaries of the West, turning the cloud into a "second home" for western iGEMers — a place where they can share data, access mentorship, and collaborate in real time regardless of location.

At the same time, I want to guide our community from "following innovation" to "creating local innovation." The southwest region has unique social and environmental contexts — agriculture, ecology, and sustainable development challenges. By encouraging teams to focus on regional needs, we can help synthetic biology speak for local communities and bring science closer to society.

This vision is not only about expanding participation, but also about shaping a distinct "Western China voice" in the global iGEM landscape.

## 3. If selected as an Ambassador, what would be your main focus areas or goals, based on your understanding of the recruitment requirements and your region's needs?

If selected as an iGEM Ambassador, my priority would be to build a connected, inclusive, and sustainable ecosystem for synthetic biology in Western China.

### 1. Establish a Regional Hub Platform:

I would create an online hub that includes a Chinese-language knowledge base, open-source dry-lab codes, experiment manuals, and active communication channels such as WeChat or forum groups. This would lower the language barrier and offer accessible learning resources to new teams.

### 2. Launch the "Bio Outreach Program":

I aim to expand outreach to underdeveloped areas such as Ganzi and Liangshan by designing a "school-to-university" bridge program. This initiative would introduce synthetic biology to high school students, ensuring early exposure and inspiring the next generation of innovators.

### 3. Promote the "Bio-for-Region" Initiative:

To attract attention from industries and local governments, I plan to integrate iGEM with regional economic and ecological priorities. For example:

- Applying synthetic biology to agricultural waste management,
- Using microbial synthesis for ecological restoration in the Sichuan–Tibet region,
- Partnering with local biotech companies for sustainable product development.

Through these actions, I hope to demonstrate that synthetic biology is not only a research field but also a tool for regional transformation and sustainable growth.

Ultimately, my goal is to make the iGEM community in Western China more visible, interconnected, and impactful — empowering young scientists to innovate locally and collaborate globally.
