I was delighted to attend the ICTXVII International Congress of Toxicology (ICT2025), which was an incredibly meaningful academic experience. At this conference, I met many outstanding scholars and peers, and gained valuable learning and networking opportunities.

## My Oral Presentation

At this conference, I had the privilege of delivering an oral presentation titled "Safety by Design for Anti-aging Peptides De Novo Design." This presentation showcased my recent research work in anti-aging peptide design, particularly how to integrate safety considerations into the de novo design process of peptides.

Through this presentation, I not only shared my research findings but also received valuable suggestions and feedback from experts in different fields. These insights will be of great significance for guiding my future research work.

## Academic Exchange and Insights

As a newcomer to the field of toxicology, this conference gave me a deep appreciation for the broad prospects and infinite possibilities of this field. I met many senior professors and PhD students whose research approaches and methodologies provided me with great inspiration.

Through exchanges with scholars from different research backgrounds, I learned about the latest development trends in toxicology research and saw the potential of emerging interdisciplinary fields such as computational toxicology and molecular toxicology. These exchanges not only broadened my academic horizons but also provided new ideas for my future research directions.

## Vision for the Field of Toxicology

I hope that the field of toxicology will continue to improve and make greater contributions to human health and environmental protection. With the development of technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data, I believe that toxicology research will usher in new development opportunities, enabling more precise assessment of chemical safety and providing support for formulating more scientific regulatory policies.

Through this conference, I have become more determined to deepen my commitment to the field of toxicology, and I look forward to collaborating with more peers in the future to jointly promote the development of this field.
