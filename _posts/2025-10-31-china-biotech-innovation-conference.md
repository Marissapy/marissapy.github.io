I was delighted to attend the 2025 China Biotechnology Innovation Conference, which provided an excellent platform for exchanging ideas and connecting with leading researchers in the field of biotechnology and life sciences.

## Reconnecting with Mentors and Colleagues

One of the highlights of the conference was the opportunity to reconnect with Prof. Han, my advisor's advisor. It was wonderful to see him again and discuss the latest developments in our research field. These connections across academic generations are invaluable, as they provide both historical perspective and forward-looking insights into the evolution of scientific research.

I also had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Lyu, a long-time collaborator and friend with whom we have maintained ongoing academic exchanges. Our conversations during the conference were particularly enriching, and we even had the chance to share a dinner together, where we discussed not only our current research projects but also the future directions of biotechnology and aging research.

## Reflections on AI and Longevity Science

One of the most significant insights from this conference was the recognition that, in the context of artificial intelligence, research in longevity science and anti-aging will become increasingly efficient. The integration of AI technologies—including machine learning, deep learning, and large language models—is revolutionizing how we approach complex biological questions.

AI-powered tools are enabling researchers to:
- Analyze vast datasets of aging-related biomarkers and pathways
- Predict the effects of potential anti-aging interventions with greater accuracy
- Accelerate drug discovery and development processes
- Identify novel targets and mechanisms underlying the aging process

This technological advancement is particularly exciting for the field of longevity science, as it allows us to move from hypothesis-driven research to data-driven discovery, potentially uncovering new insights that would have been difficult or impossible to identify through traditional experimental approaches alone.

The convergence of AI and aging research represents a paradigm shift that promises to accelerate our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of aging and develop more effective interventions to promote healthy longevity. As we continue to harness the power of AI in this field, I believe we are on the cusp of transformative breakthroughs that will benefit human health and quality of life.
